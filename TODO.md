- Read main.rs and inspect the commands inside it. I have already created a product called "wei", which reads data/wei/windows/build.dat and compiles different directories accordingly. Now I want to create a new product called "burncloud" and add a new data/burncloud/windows/build.dat file. It is similar to wei's build.dat, except its UI is the burncloud repository, which is at the same level as the wei-ui-vue directory. Please help modify the code so these directories are compiled into wei-release/burncloud/windows; the mac and linux builds should be handled similarly.
